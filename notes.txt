-Template string uses ${} not $()
-if want to select 1 tag then do querySelector or else if querySelectorAll you need to loop through the returned array
-function name () {} must use "this." to refer to the event obj
  -the entire function gets hoisted
-let name = () => {} "THIS" is applied instrinsically
  -function will not be hoisted
-tag.classList IS NOT a function so don't have to do "()"
-tag.classList.toggle("className") don't have to worry about the other names being affected

-tag.style.backgroundColor = " "
-tag.textContent = " " 
-Events
  - e.target.style.backgroundColor
  - e.target.textContent




-Questions:
  -When you use e.preventDefault
  -css .square{padding-bottom: 30%;????}
